# CHIP-8 Interpreter

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language designed in the 1970s for the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 microcomputers. It was created by Joseph Weisbecker and was used primarily for game development.

While not a hardware architecture, CHIP-8 includes both a virtual machine and an associated set of conventions for designing simple video games.
